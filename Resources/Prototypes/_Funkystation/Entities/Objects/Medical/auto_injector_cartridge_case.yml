#Potential future ideas include a large case, kind of like pistol case with an injector AND the small case inside for sec armoury potentially? Could have 'advanced' cartridges with stronger mixes,
#also potentially a little 'pez dispenser' which could be like a 1x1 like a pill bottle and hold a few which are ejected perhaps, or could be quickloaded into the injector?
